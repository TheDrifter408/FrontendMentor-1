## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I gained some knowledge regarding how to structure elements properly with CSS Flexbox and Grid, but my solution isn't perfect as such I know that more practice is required to master responsive layouts.

### Continued development
What is most clear from this project for me is my need for a better understanding in responsive layouts using CSS and media queries. I also require greater understanding of CSS grid.
